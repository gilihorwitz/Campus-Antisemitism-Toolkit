            <h1>Escalation Guide</h1>
            <p>Sometimes campus administration doesn't respond adequately, or incidents require action beyond the university level. This guide helps you know when and how to escalate.</p>

            <h2>When to Escalate</h2>
            <p>Consider escalating when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You've reported an incident and received no response after 5-7 business days</li>
                <li>The university's response is inadequate or dismissive</li>
                <li>The incident involves criminal activity (threats, violence, vandalism)</li>
                <li>There's a pattern of incidents that aren't being addressed</li>
                <li>You feel unsafe and campus isn't taking appropriate action</li>
                <li>The incident involves discrimination that may violate Title VI</li>
                <li>You've exhausted campus channels without resolution</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Escalation Levels</h2>

            <h3>Level 1: Within University (Higher Administration)</h3>
            <p>If your initial contact doesn't respond or isn't helpful:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Go up the chain:</strong> Contact the supervisor of the person you initially reached out to</li>
                <li><strong>Contact multiple offices:</strong> Dean of Students, Title IX, Diversity Office, President's Office</li>
                <li><strong>CC multiple people:</strong> Send emails with multiple administrators copied</li>
                <li><strong>Request meetings:</strong> Ask for in-person meetings with higher-level administrators</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Who to contact:</strong> Dean of Students, Vice President of Student Affairs, University President, Board of Trustees</p>

            <h3>Level 2: External Advocacy Organizations</h3>
            <p>These organizations can provide support, advocacy, and sometimes legal assistance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ADL (Anti-Defamation League):</strong> Reports incidents, provides advocacy, can engage with universities</li>
                <li><strong>Hillel International:</strong> Can advocate for Jewish students and engage with university leadership</li>
                <li><strong>StandWithUs:</strong> Provides educational resources and advocacy</li>
                <li><strong>AMCHA Initiative:</strong> Monitors and responds to antisemitism on campus</li>
                <li><strong>Jewish on Campus:</strong> Amplifies student voices and advocates for change</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>When to contact:</strong> When you need external pressure, legal support, or when campus isn't responding</p>

            <h3>Level 3: Legal and Government</h3>
            <p>For serious incidents or when discrimination may be occurring:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Department of Education Office for Civil Rights:</strong> File a Title VI complaint for discrimination</li>
                <li><strong>ADL Legal Support:</strong> Legal resources and support for Jewish students</li>
                <li><strong>Local police:</strong> For criminal activity (threats, violence, vandalism)</li>
                <li><strong>State Attorney General:</strong> Some states have offices that handle discrimination complaints</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>When to contact:</strong> When there's potential legal violation, criminal activity, or when other channels have failed</p>

            <h3>Level 4: Media and Public Pressure</h3>
            <p>Use carefully and strategically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Student newspaper:</strong> Can raise awareness and pressure administration</li>
                <li><strong>Local media:</strong> Can bring public attention to issues</li>
                <li><strong>Social media:</strong> Can amplify your voice (but be thoughtful about privacy and safety)</li>
                <li><strong>National Jewish media:</strong> Forward, Jewish Journal, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>When to use:</strong> When other methods haven't worked, or when you want to raise broader awareness</p>
            <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> This can escalate situations quickly. Consider privacy, safety, and whether you're ready for public attention.</p>

            <h2>How to Escalate Effectively</h2>

            <h3>Document Everything</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep records of all communications</li>
                <li>Document responses (or lack thereof)</li>
                <li>Note dates, times, and who you've contacted</li>
                <li>Save all emails and responses</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Be Clear About What You've Done</h3>
            <p>When escalating, explain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What incident(s) occurred</li>
                <li>Who you've already contacted</li>
                <li>What responses you've received (or lack thereof)</li>
                <li>Why you're escalating now</li>
                <li>What you're asking for</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Provide Complete Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Include your incident documentation</li>
                <li>Provide evidence (photos, screenshots, etc.)</li>
                <li>Share timeline of events</li>
                <li>Explain the impact</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Important Considerations</h2>

            <h3>Timing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Give initial channels reasonable time to respond (5-7 business days)</li>
                <li>Don't escalate too quickly, but don't wait indefinitely</li>
                <li>Escalate when you have clear evidence that initial channels aren't working</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Privacy and Safety</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Consider your safety when deciding to escalate</li>
                <li>Be thoughtful about what information you share publicly</li>
                <li>Protect the privacy of other students unless they consent</li>
                <li>Consider whether escalation might make you a target</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Support</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't escalate alone—get support from friends, family, or organizations</li>
                <li>Consider working with advocacy organizations who have experience</li>
                <li>Take care of your mental health—this can be stressful</li>
                <li>Know that escalating is sometimes necessary and you have the right to do it</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>You're Not Alone</h2>
            <p>Escalating can feel scary, but remember:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have a right to feel safe on campus</li>
                <li>You have a right to have incidents taken seriously</li>
                <li>There are organizations and people who want to help</li>
                <li>You're doing something important for yourself and your community</li>
                <li>Many students have successfully escalated and seen positive outcomes</li>
            </ul>
