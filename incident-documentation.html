            <h2>Tips for Documentation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Document immediately:</strong> Write down details while they're fresh in your memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Be factual:</strong> Stick to what happened, not assumptions about intent.</li>
                <li><strong>Save evidence:</strong> Take photos, screenshots, or save messages immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep copies:</strong> Store documentation in multiple places (cloud, email to yourself).</li>
                <li><strong>Include context:</strong> Note if this is part of a pattern or related to other incidents.</li>
                <li><strong>Get witness contact info:</strong> Ask witnesses if they're willing to provide statements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When to Use This Template</h2>
            <p>Use this template for any incident that makes you feel targeted, unsafe, or discriminated against because of your Jewish identity. Even if you're not sure whether something "counts," document it. You can decide later whether to report it.</p>
