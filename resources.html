            <ul>

                <li><strong>Title IX Office:</strong> Handles discrimination complaints (though Title VI may be more relevant for antisemitism)</li>
                <li><strong>Diversity & Inclusion Office:</strong> May have resources and can advocate for inclusive campus climate</li>
                <li><strong>Campus Security/Police:</strong> For immediate safety concerns and to report criminal activity</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>How This Toolkit Complements These Resources</h2>
            <p>This toolkit is designed to work alongside (not replace) these official resources:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Official organizations</strong> provide advocacy, legal support, and institutional power</li>
                <li><strong>This toolkit</strong> provides practical, student-created templates and frameworks</li>
                <li><strong>Use both:</strong> Report to official organizations AND use these templates for your own documentation and communication</li>
                <li><strong>Share feedback:</strong> If you find gaps or have suggestions, let both official organizations and this toolkit know</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Important Notes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>These resources are current as of when this toolkit was created, but organizations may update their websites or services</li>
                <li>If a link doesn't work, try searching for the organization name directly</li>
                <li>Many of these organizations have local chapters or representatives—reach out to see what's available in your area</li>
                <li>Don't hesitate to contact multiple resources—you don't have to choose just one</li>
                <li>If you're in immediate danger, call 911 or campus security</li>
            </ul>
